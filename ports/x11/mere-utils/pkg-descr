Utility bundle for mere system interface 
An simple utility library contains common reusable functionality of components 
that are used in mere projects.
Currently it has following helpers and will grow over time:
- AppUtils
- EnvUtils
- BinUtils
- FileUtils
- FolderUtls
- i18Utils
- IconUtils
- PathUtils
- ProcessUtils
- SignalUtils
- StringUtils
etc...

Note:
mere system interface is an interface to your system, it will work like your
traditional desktop environment with easy to modify and configure. We will
initially create ports for utility applications then step by step rest of 
the system.
